üåü Key Innovations

    Control System: Duet Mini 5 Plus with RepRapFirmware for advanced motion control and networking.  This provides a significant upgrade from the stock Ender 5 board, offering more processing power, more drivers, and better connectivity.  RepRapFirmware allows for highly customizable control over the printer's behavior.

    Print Head Management: Duet 3 Toolboard 1LC with onboard accelerometer for input shaping.  By placing a toolboard directly on the print head, we reduce wiring complexity and improve signal integrity.  The onboard accelerometer enables input shaping, a technique that minimizes ringing and vibrations during high-speed printing.

    Hotend: E3D Revo system supporting quick nozzle swaps and wear-resistant printing.  The E3D Revo system allows for fast and easy nozzle changes without the need for tools, and its wear-resistant components improve print quality and longevity.

    Bed Leveling: Duet3D IR Probe for precise calibration.  An infrared probe provides more accurate and reliable bed leveling compared to mechanical probes, ensuring consistent first-layer adhesion.  Future plans include a scanning Z probe for even more detailed bed surface mapping.

    Filament Management: Runout detection and weight-based tracking.

        Runout detection prevents print failures by pausing the print when the filament runs out.

        Weight-based tracking allows for monitoring filament consumption, which can be used to estimate print progress, detect potential flow rate issues, and predict when the filament will run out.

    Environmental Sensing: VL53L0X Time-of-Flight sensors and acoustic monitoring.

        VL53L0X sensors are used for dynamic recalibration.  These sensors can measure the distance to the print bed and other components, allowing the printer to automatically adjust its calibration over time to compensate for thermal expansion or mechanical changes.

        Acoustic monitoring with an INMP441 microphone and Raspberry Pi 4 is used for failure detection.  By analyzing the sound emitted by the printer, the system can detect anomalies that may indicate a problem, such as extruder skipping or a part detaching from the bed.

    User Interface: Duet3D PanelDue touchscreen.  A touchscreen provides a more intuitive and user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the printer compared to the stock LCD screen.

    Software & Automation: RepRapFirmware, Object Model & Duet Web Control API.

        RepRapFirmware provides a foundation for advanced control and customization.

        The Object Model allows for real-time access to the printer's status and parameters.

        The Duet Web Control API enables remote monitoring and control from any web browser.

        Accelerometer-based input shaping minimizes vibrations and improves print speed and quality.

        VL53L0X data interfacing enables automatic recalibration.

        Future development includes machine learning-based failure detection and IR camera integration for thermal and geometric monitoring.
